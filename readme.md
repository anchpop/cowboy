# Cowboy ðŸ¤ 

A thread-safe wrapper for shared data with a focus on ergonomics.

Designed for quick prototyping, when you don't really want to think about lifetimes and just want to get something working as fast as possible.

## What is it?

Cowboy is a thin wrapper around `Arc<RwLock<T>>` that makes it easier to work with shared, mutable state across threads. It provides simple methods for reading and writing data without the hassle of explicit locking and error handling. It also provides 

## Features

- Thread-safe shared data with interior mutability
- Simple API: just use `.r()` to read and `.w()` to write
- Implements common traits like `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Hash`, etc.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations
- Unsafe methods for when you want to break the rules

## Quick Start

```rust
use cowboy::{cowboy, SHERIFF};

// Create a shared counter
let counter = cowboy(0);
let counter_2 = counter.clone();


println!("Counter: {counter}");

// Modify the value
{
    let mut value = counter.w();
    *value += 1;
}

assert_eq!(counter, counter_2);

// Add the counter to the global registry
SHERIFF.register("counter", counter);
// Access from anywhere
let counter = SHERIFF.get::<i32>("counter");
counter.w() += 1;
```
