# Cowboy ðŸ¤ 

A thread-safe wrapper for shared data with a focus on ergonomics.

Designed for quick prototyping, when you don't really want to think about lifetimes and just want to get something working as fast as possible.

## What is it?

Cowboy is a thin wrapper around `Arc<RwLock<T>>` that makes it easier to work with shared, mutable state across threads. It provides simple methods for reading and writing data without the hassle of explicit locking and error handling. 

`Cowboy` has some convenient trait implementations. You can compare `Cowboy` values for equality, put them in `HashSet`s and `BTreeSet`s, and so on (provided the backing type implements `Eq`, `Hash`, or `Ord` respectively). `Cowboy` also implements `Debug` and `Display`.

## Features

- Thread-safe shared data with interior mutability
- Simple API: just use `.r()` to read and `.w()` to write
- Implements common traits like `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Hash`, etc.
- Supports basic arithmetic operations
- Unsafe methods for when you want to break the rules
- `SHERIFF` for storing cowboys for later access. 

## Quick Start

```rust
use cowboy::{cowboy, SHERIFF};

// Create a shared counter
let counter = cowboy(0);
let counter_2 = counter.clone();

println!("Counter: {counter}");

// Modify the value
{
    let mut value = counter.w();
    *value += 1;
}

assert_eq!(counter, counter_2);

// Add the counter to the global registry
SHERIFF.register("counter", counter);
// Access from anywhere
let counter = SHERIFF.get::<i32>("counter");
*counter.w() += 1;
```

I think we can all agree that you shouldn't use `Cowboy` or `SHERIFF` in production code, but I'm hopeful it can be useful for when you're prototyping and want the borrow checker to get out of your way.
