# Cowboy ðŸ¤ 

A thread-safe wrapper for shared data with a focus on ergonomics.

Designed for quick prototyping, when you don't really want to think about lifetimes and just want to get something working as fast as possible.

## What is it?

`Cowboy<T>`  is just a wrapper for `Arc<RwLock<T>>` that's designed to be less ugly. It has more concise method names, and lots of trait implementations that make it work in more situations. (It implements `Eq`, `Hash`, `Ord`, and so on as long as the underlying type supports it). 

## Features

- Thread-safe shared data with interior mutability.
- Simple API: just use `.r()` to read and `.w()` to write.
- Implements common traits like `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Hash`, etc.
- Unsafe methods for those who want to break the rules.
- `SHERIFF` for global cowboy storage. 
- Zero-boilerplate serialization and deserialization.

## Quick Start

I think we can all agree that you shouldn't use `Cowboy` or `SHERIFF` in production code, but I'm hopeful it can be useful for when you're prototyping and want the borrow checker to get out of your way. Here's how they work:

### Basic usage

```rust
use cowboy::*;

// use `.cowboy()` on any value to get a Cowboy version of it.
let counter = 0.cowboy();

println!("Counter: {counter}");

// Cloning a cowboy gives you a pointer to the same underlying data
let counter_2 = counter.clone();

// Modify the value
*counter.w() += 1;

// Both counter and counter_2 were modified
assert_eq!(counter, counter_2); 
```

### Global storage with `SHERIFF`

```rust
use cowboy::*;

let counter = 0.cowboy();

// You can register cowboys with the SHERIFF using any key type
SHERIFF.register("counter", counter.clone());
SHERIFF.register(42, counter.clone());

// Access from anywhere
let counter_1 = SHERIFF.get::<_, i32>("counter");
let counter_2 = SHERIFF.get::<_, i32>(42); // Note: not &42

*counter_1.w() += 1;
*counter_1.w() += 2;
*counter_2.w() += 3;

// All counters should have the same value since they're all clones of the same original counter
assert_eq!(counter_1, counter_2);
println!("Counter: {counter}");
```

### Zero-boilerplate saving and loading

```rust
use cowboy::*;

let counter = 0.cowboy();

counter.save("counter.json");

let new_counter = Cowboy::<i64>::load("counter.json");

println!("Counter: {counter}");
```
